# Writing Style Guide

## Core Principles

- Direct, concise, and brutally honest
- Zero tolerance for corporate waffle or buzzwords
- Experience-based insights over theoretical frameworks
- UK English spelling and conventions
- Strong opinions, loosely held

## Voice and Tone

- Conversational but authoritative
- First person perspective, drawing from personal experience
- Informal but professional - occasional swearing is fine when it serves a point
- Challenge accepted wisdom and call out bullshit directly
- Use humour sparingly and naturally - never forced

## Content Structure

1. Hook with a provocative statement or question
2. Personal context/experience to establish credibility
3. Core argument backed by real examples
4. Clear, actionable takeaways
5. Strong closing statement that ties back to the opening

## Writing Style

- Short, punchy paragraphs
- Use questions to drive points home
- Bold text for emphasis on key points
- Break up long sections with clear subheadings
- Use analogies to explain complex ideas
- Embrace white space and readability

## Language Guidelines

- Active voice over passive
- Concrete examples over abstract concepts
- Real numbers and specifics where possible
- UK spelling (organisation not organization)
- UK date format (15 October 2023)
- Contractions are fine (don't, won't, can't)
- Technical terms without explanation (unless specifically writing for beginners)

## Formatting

### Headers
- Main title: Clear, provocative, no bullshit
- Subheadings: Descriptive but brief
- Use sentence case for all headers

### Emphasis
- **Bold** for key points and emphasis
- *Italics* for subtle emphasis or quotes
- No underlining
- Links should be [descriptive](url), not bare URLs

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. Corporate speak or jargon
2. Excessive politeness or hedging
3. Overly complex explanations
4. Unnecessary disclaimers
5. Marketing-style hype
6. Hand-holding through basic concepts

## Content Categories
