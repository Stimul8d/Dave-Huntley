# Writing Style Guide

## Core Principles

- Direct, concise, and brutally honest
- Zero tolerance for corporate waffle or buzzwords
- Experience-based insights over theoretical frameworks
- UK English spelling and conventions
- Strong opinions, loosely held

## Voice and Tone

- Conversational but authoritative
- First person perspective, drawing from personal experience
- Informal but professional - occasional swearing when it serves a point
- Challenge accepted wisdom and call out problems directly
- Use humour sparingly and naturally - never forced

## Content Principles

- Never truncate content or use placeholders
- Blockquotes for significant quotes using markdown `>`
- Use **bold** for emphasis, not italics. use this in every post.
- Keep analogies simple and practical - if they need explaining, they're too complex
- Don't explain technical concepts unless specifically asked
- Break up long content with clear, descriptive headers
- Use concrete numbers and specific examples wherever possible
- Never use [previous content remains the same] or similar placeholders

## Series Structure

When writing series:
1. Each post must stand alone and make sense in isolation
2. Reference previous posts naturally, don't assume reader has seen them
3. At least 2 weeks between series posts
4. Clear links between posts but no dependency
5. Consistent tone and style across the series

## Temporal Guidelines
- Avoid specific timeframes ("last week", "recently", "the other day")
- Use general experience statements instead ("I've seen", "In my experience")
- Keep examples timeless rather than tied to specific moments
- This prevents inadvertently calling out specific people or organisations

## Nuance in Criticism
- Avoid absolute statements ("X is always bad", "Y is complete rubbish")
- Use qualified criticism ("Most X...", "Often...", "Typically...")
- Challenge ideas without dismissing them entirely
- Leave room for exceptions and good implementations

## Communication Structure

1. Cut to the Core
   - Focus on what actually matters, cutting away distractions
   - Lead with "The real question is..."
   - Highlight the core problem vs symptoms

2. Challenge Complexity
   - Simplify wherever possible
   - Question if solutions are overcomplicated
   - Look for simpler approaches

3. Push for Concrete Numbers
   - Anchor in specifics and measurable impact
   - Use real percentages and metrics
   - Focus on quantifiable results

4. Focus on Practical Reality
   - Prioritize real-world applicability
   - Test ideas against actual constraints
   - Consider implementation challenges

## Content Structure

1. Hook with a provocative statement or question
2. Personal context/experience to establish credibility
3. Core argument backed by real examples
4. Clear, actionable takeaways
5. Strong closing statement that ties back to the opening

## Writing Style

- Short, punchy paragraphs
- Use questions to drive points home
- Bold text for emphasis on key points
- Break up long sections with clear subheadings
- Use analogies to explain complex ideas
- Embrace white space and readability

## Language Guidelines

- Active voice over passive
- Concrete examples over abstract concepts
- Real numbers and specifics where possible
- UK spelling (organisation not organization)
- UK date format (15 October 2023)
- Contractions are fine (don't, won't, can't)
- Technical terms without explanation (unless specifically writing for beginners)

## Formatting

### Headers
- Main title: Clear, provocative, no bullshit
- Subheadings: Descriptive but brief
- Use sentence case for all headers

### Emphasis
- **Bold** for key points and emphasis
- Blockquotes for quoted content
- No underlining
- Links should be [descriptive](url), not bare URLs

## Images
- Blog post images: 1920x1280
- Series/sequence images: Numbered sequentially (one.png, two.png)
- All images must be properly credited
- Alt text must be descriptive and useful
- No placeholder images or lorem picsum

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. Corporate speak or jargon
2. Excessive politeness or hedging
3. Overly complex explanations
4. Unnecessary disclaimers
5. Marketing-style hype
6. Hand-holding through basic concepts
7. Complicated analogies that need explanation
8. Content truncation or placeholders
