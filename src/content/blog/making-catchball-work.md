Imagine playing catch with yourself. Stupid idea, right? Yet that's exactly how most organisations handle strategy - throwing ideas into the void and hoping someone catches them.

**Catchball is different.**

## What is Catchball?

Catchball is the core dialogue process in strategy deployment. It's a structured way of passing ideas back and forth between levels of an organisation until you reach proper alignment.

Think of your strategy like a ball:
- Senior leaders throw out the initial direction
- Teams catch it, examine it, improve it
- They throw back their understanding and concerns
- This continues until everyone's clear on the plan

The magic happens in the back-and-forth. Each time the ball moves, the strategy gets sharper, more practical, more achievable.

## Why It Matters

Most strategy sessions are a complete waste of time. Senior leaders present their vision, middle management nods along, and everyone else checks their phones under the table.

The result? A strategy that looks brilliant on paper but falls apart in practice because:
- Front-line teams spot problems no one else saw
- Middle managers know it won't work but weren't asked
- Senior leaders don't understand the real constraints

**Catchball fixes this by making strategy a two-way conversation.**

## The Real Problem

Your x-matrix is only as good as the conversations that build it. Get those conversations wrong and you'll end up with a pretty spreadsheet that doesn't drive any real change.

The reason most organisations mess this up? They treat strategy deployment like a broadcast instead of a dialogue.

## What Actually Works

Good catchball sessions share some key traits:
1. Clear scope for each conversation
2. Right people in the room
3. Strict timebox
4. Visible output
5. Clear next steps

**Miss any of these and you're just having another meeting.**

## The Ground Rules

Before you start:

1. **One Section at a Time**
   - Focus on a single part of the matrix
   - No jumping ahead to tactics when discussing strategy
   - Park good ideas that come too early

2. **Everyone Speaks**
   - Go round the room systematically
   - No dominating voices
   - Written ideas if people are hesitant

3. **Numbers Drive Decisions**
   - Every correlation needs justification
   - If you can't explain a 3, it's not a 3
   - Low scores are fine - they show honesty

4. **Visible Working**
   - Project the matrix
   - Update it live
   - Everyone sees the changes

## The Facilitator's Job

Your facilitator needs to:
1. Keep time
2. Ensure equal input
3. Challenge weak correlations
4. Park detailed discussions
5. Capture discarded ideas

**Most importantly: shut down any attempt to solve problems in the room.**

## Common Failure Modes

1. **The Echo Chamber**
   - Signs: Everyone agrees too quickly
   - Fix: Deliberately seek opposing views
   - Ask: "What could make this fail?"

2. **The Detail Trap**
   - Signs: Deep dives into implementation
   - Fix: Park it for later
   - Ask: "Does this affect our scoring?"

3. **The Hypothesis Game**
   - Signs: "What if" scenarios dominate
   - Fix: Focus on what you know now
   - Ask: "What evidence supports that?"

4. **The Peace Treaty**
   - Signs: Scores of 2 everywhere
   - Fix: Force extreme scores
   - Ask: "Why isn't this a 3?"

## Making It Real

Here's a solid format that works:

1. **15 Minutes: Context**
   - Review previous section
   - Clear scope for this session
   - Questions only on process

2. **30 Minutes: Input**
   - Round-robin suggestions
   - No discussion yet
   - Capture everything

3. **30 Minutes: Scoring**
   - Evaluate each connection
   - Challenge low/high scores
   - Remove weak items

4. **15 Minutes: Review**
   - Check overall pattern
   - Identify gaps
   - Agree next steps

## Between Sessions

Your matrix will take several sessions to complete. Between them:

1. **Publish Working**
   - Share the current state
   - Include parked items
   - Note key decisions

2. **Prep Work**
   - Review correlations
   - Gather evidence
   - Think through gaps

3. **Mini-Catchball**
   - Small group discussions
   - Test assumptions
   - Build understanding

## When to Stop

You're done when:
1. Every correlation has a clear justification
2. Weak connections are removed or fixed
3. Everyone understands their part
4. Next actions are clear

**If you can't explain every number on your matrix, you're not finished.**

## Moving Forward

Catchball isn't a one-off exercise. Use it for:
1. Quarterly reviews
2. Strategy adjustments
3. New initiatives
4. Team alignment

The process might feel slow at first. That's fine. You're trading upfront time for better execution later.

## Making It Stick

Three things make this work:
1. **Respect the Process**
   - Follow the format
   - Trust the facilitator
   - Park good ideas that come too early

2. **Focus on Facts**
   - Evidence drives scores
   - Challenge assumptions
   - Be honest about gaps

3. **Keep It Visible**
   - Update in real time
   - Share widely
   - Review regularly

Remember: **Strategy deployment fails when it's a presentation. It works when it's a conversation.**
