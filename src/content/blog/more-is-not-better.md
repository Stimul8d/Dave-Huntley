Most software businesses choose to compete on features. They'll tell you about their "rich feature set" and how they can build anything you need. It sounds great until you realise you're being sold a lie.

Here's how it usually goes: A big prospect says they'll buy your software if you just add these couple of "essential" features. The deal's too good to pass up, so you build them. Everyone gets a Christmas bonus, management are happy, job done.

**Except it's not done. It's just beginning.**

## More is an Addiction

That new client? They've just set a precedent. Every prospect after them will have their own specific needs. To win those contracts, you'll cave to those too. 

Even worse, you've trained your organisation to believe what you have isn't enough. You might be right, but you won't fix it by building even more software. That road leads to stressed developers, dodgy releases and death marches.

## The Infinite Software Trap

Software development can be bizarre. I once worked with fewer than 10 people maintaining over 2 million lines of C++ built up over 15 years. **That's 200,000+ lines each!** 

Imagine asking 10 mechanical engineers to keep building something non-stop for 15 years. You'd think they were mad. Yet in software, especially in finance and enterprise, this is normal. You know your bank still runs on COBOL, right?

Software's intangible nature tricks us into thinking we can build forever. We've cycled through endless fads claiming to save us from ourselves - design patterns, SOLID, TDD, BDD, CI/CD, DDD, microservices. They all help, but none change a fundamental truth:

**You can only maintain so much code.**

## Empires Fall

Some organisations get away with it for a while. If margins are high enough, any new feature can boost the balance sheet. But software is more than size.

As products grow, organisations split responsibilities across teams. Maybe by speciality (database team, middleware team, frontend team - shudder), or maybe you're smarter and have cross-functional product teams.

Better, but not enough if your goal is more. Eventually, change and complexity sink the battleship.

## More People Won't Fix This

Let's be clear:
1. More software = more complexity
2. Complex things are harder to change
3. Change is constant

**So why build something that can't handle change?**

Software complexity grows exponentially, not linearly. You might hire three times more developers when your product doubles in size. What about when it doubles again? And again?

Even split into pieces, it all needs to work together. You can't hire for that kind of growth. Even if you could, it would destroy your margins.

## Embrace Better

Skateboards are brilliantly simple. Four wheels, a board and (if you're luckier than I was) some brakes. There's little else to them because there doesn't need to be.

The skateboard industry doesn't compete on more - they compete on better. Better trucks. Lighter decks. Smoother bearings. Everything focuses on perfecting what a skateboard should be.

**They don't stick wings on and pretend it's an aeroplane.**

They don't make a "family edition" with four boards stuck together. Sure, someone might want a jet-powered one, but you know what? Don't sell it to them! It's not worth the hassle.

## Start Here

Your software needs one clear purpose. Here's how to find it:

1. **Spend time with your users**
   - Do their job for a week
   - Note their frustrations
   - Learn their shortcuts
   - Understand their actual needs

2. **Audit your features**
   - List everything your software does
   - Mark which features work together
   - Identify what fights against itself
   - Flag anything that's "flexible" - it's probably trying to do too much

3. **Draw hard lines**
   - Split features that don't belong together
   - Remove anything that doesn't serve the core purpose
   - Say no to things that pull you off course
   - Be ruthless - every feature costs you in complexity

You won't get it perfect first time. That's fine. **Focus on making one thing brilliant instead of ten things average.**
