The daily scrum is meant to be a planning session. When was the last time your team actually made a plan in one?

Most standups are just glorified status reports. Everyone takes turns answering those three magic questions:
- What did I do yesterday?
- What am I doing today?
- What's blocking me?

Then there's that awkward moment where everyone stares at their shoes before shuffling back to their desks, no clearer on what needs doing than when they walked in.

## Why Most Standups Fail

The activities don't match the purpose. We're trying to plan our day by listing what we've already decided to do. That's not planning - it's just synchronising calendars.

Scrum tells us to have these planning meetings but conveniently forgets to mention how individual status updates magically transform into a team plan. Brilliant.

## Option 1: Focus on Outcomes

If you're genuinely working iteratively (and I don't mean two-week waterfalls with fancy names), here's what to do:

Start with your sprint goal. But not those rubbish ones like "finish all the stories on the board". I mean actual goals that matter.

Instead of "Create a Login and Password Reset System", try "Users can't access their accounts". One's a shopping list. The other's a problem that needs solving.

Replace those three questions with one: "How are we solving this problem today?"

Problem-solving is developer catnip. Give them a real challenge instead of a task list and watch what happens.

## Option 2: Focus on Flow

If you're not ready for proper iteration (fair enough), focus on getting work done efficiently:

1. Walk the board from right to left - focus on what's closest to done
2. Put a dot on cards for each day they're stuck
3. Make those dots visible and painful
4. Talk about the stuck work first

When people can see work getting stuck, they start caring about moving it. When they care about moving it, they help each other. That's actual teamwork, not the pretend kind we put in slide decks.

## What Good Looks Like

A proper standup should end with:
- Clear priorities for the next few hours
- Obvious places where help is needed
- Actual plans for pairing or mobbing on stuck work
- Everyone knowing what "done" looks like today

If you're not getting that, you're just doing orchestrated status theatre.

## Make It Work

Your standups are probably rubbish because you're not honest about what you're trying to achieve. 

If you just want to get work done, embrace that and focus on flow. If you want to solve problems, focus on problems.

But stop pretending that everyone reading their calendar entries is planning. It's not.

Real teams solve problems together. If you want teamwork, give them something worth teaming up for.
