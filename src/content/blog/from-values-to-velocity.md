Every job listing wants "experience in an Agile setting". But what the fuck does that even mean anymore?

Twenty years ago, agile was a radical response to broken software development. We were treating developers like replaceable cogs, following plans off cliffs, and lying to customers about what we could deliver.

Then the dot-com bubble burst, and suddenly pretending everything was fine wasn't working anymore. We needed something better.

## The Revolution That Was

A group of developers proposed something revolutionary: what if we actually valued:
- Working software over endless documentation
- Real collaboration over rigid contracts
- Customer needs over internal politics
- Adapting to reality over following a plan

It wasn't just a new process. It was a complete rejection of how software was being built. And for a while, it worked brilliantly.

## How We Killed It

Fast forward to today. We've managed to take a movement about valuing humans and turned it into velocity metrics and story point velocity targets. Well done, us.

The same managers who used to control us with Gantt charts now control us with sprint burndowns. The only difference is they're speaking our language while they do it.

Want to spot zombie agile? Look for these red flags:
- Sprints that look suspiciously like mini-waterfalls
- People obsessing over the "right way" to do story points
- Velocity being used as a performance metric
- Scrum being treated as an unchangeable religion

If any of this sounds familiar, you've been had.

## The Death of Learning

The core of agile was simple: try something, see if it works, adjust based on what you learn. Deming figured this out in the 1950s with PDCA (plan-do-check-act).

But we've replaced learning with orthodoxy. Teams spend more time debating whether something is "true Scrum" than asking if Scrum is even helping them deliver better software.

Here's the thing about good ideas: they have a shelf life. The moment you stop questioning them, they start rotting.

## What Actually Matters

Want to know if you're really doing agile? Forget the ceremonies and ask:

1. Are your developers treated like experts or resources?
2. Is your software actually working?
3. Do you understand what your customers need?
4. Can you change direction when you're wrong?

If you answered no to any of these, all your daily standups and sprint reviews are just theatre.

## The Way Forward

Agile isn't dead, but it needs to get back to its roots:

1. Trust your professionals
2. Build working software
3. Talk to your customers
4. Accept that you're probably wrong about something

Everything else is just process porn.

And the next time someone asks about your "agile experience", ask them what they think that means. Their answer will tell you everything you need to know about whether you want to work there.
