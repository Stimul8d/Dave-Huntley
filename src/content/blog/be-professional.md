Do a quick image search for 'Professional'. You'll be confronted with an abject sea of pinstripe, handshaking, and clipboards. Somehow professionalism has become inextricably linked with appearance. But there's a darker side to this fa√ßade that we need to talk about.

## The Two-Faced Manager

I once worked with a middle-manager who was, quite frankly, terrible at his job. He'd regularly belittle people in public, demand unreasonable hours, and create a culture of fear. When I finally confronted him about his behaviour, what happened next shocked me.

Behind closed doors, his eyes welled up as he admitted he didn't recognise himself anymore. He was terrified of what he was becoming at work. This wasn't just job dissatisfaction - it was a full-blown identity crisis.

We agreed to meet outside work to talk it through. When he showed up at Starbucks that weekend, I barely recognised him. Gone was the meticulously planned executive wardrobe with its collar bars and perfect windsor knots. Instead, he wore a scruffy t-shirt, joggers and trainers that had seen better days.

The transformation wasn't just skin deep. As we talked, he told me about supporting his son's family while his daughter-in-law was in hospital. He spoke about volunteering at the local community centre to give elderly residents a place to meet. Outside of work, he was genuinely making people's lives better.

So why was he such an utter nightmare in a suit?

## The Costume Problem

His morning routine of "dressing professionally" wasn't just about clothes - it was a transformation into a character he thought he needed to be. He'd created such a stark divide between his work persona and his real self that it was eating him alive. He wasn't being professional, he was acting professional. There's a world of difference.

## Real Professionalism

Being professional isn't about what you wear. If you genuinely love wearing a suit, crack on. Some of the most impressive people I know dress up at the weekend because it's who they are.

Real professionalism is about:
- Being an expert at what you do
- Communicating with clarity and honesty
- Taking ownership of your mistakes
- Keeping your promises
- Helping others succeed
- Treating people with respect

If you're doing these things, I couldn't care less if you're wearing a three-piece suit or a t-shirt with holes in it.

## Drop the Act

Want to be more professional? Stop acting and start being. Your authentic self - with all its quirks and imperfections - is far more valuable than any corporate facade you might construct.

Be yourself. It's what people need from you.
