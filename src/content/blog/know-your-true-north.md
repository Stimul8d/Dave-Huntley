Ever sat through those endless discussions about mission statements and vision statements? The ones where everyone argues about the difference while ignoring that neither drives real decisions?

Here's what matters: If you can remove something without pain, you should.

That's not just a principle - it's a compass for every decision that matters, especially the ethical ones.

## The Problem with Most Values

Most corporate values try to define what you are. They add layers of aspiration and intention, piling on adjectives until the meaning drowns in noise.

But meaning isn't what you add - it's what remains when you strip everything else away. When you're faced with a genuine ethical dilemma, all those fancy vision statements disappear. What remains is what you actually believe.

## What Actually Works

True North is different. Instead of asking "What do we want to be?", it asks "What won't we compromise on, even when it costs us?"

Mine's simple: "If you can remove it without pain, you should."

That single principle has shaped every significant decision I've made:
- In code: If a feature doesn't hurt to remove, it shouldn't exist
- In process: If a meeting doesn't leave a gap when cancelled, cancel it
- In ethics: If cutting a corner doesn't feel wrong, your compass is broken

## Finding Your True North

Here's how to find yours:

1. Get your most honest people in a room (the ones who tell uncomfortable truths)

2. List your hardest decisions - the ones that cost you something to get right:
   - Which choices hurt your numbers but felt right?
   - When did you say no to easy money?
   - What principles did you protect at a cost?

3. Look for the pattern in what you couldn't compromise on. That's not your aspiration - that's your character.

4. Don't seek agreement. Seek the truth that makes people uncomfortable. Comfort is optional. Integrity isn't.

## Why This Matters

A real True North:
- Makes hard choices obvious
- Kills compromised ideas faster
- Stops ethical drift before it starts
- Forces honesty about priorities

## Making It Real

Once you find it:
1. Test every decision against it
2. Apply it especially when it hurts
3. Accept the commercial cost of principles
4. Let it kill profitable but wrong choices

## The Real Test

Ask yourself: What principle would you keep even when it costs you money, time, or growth?

That's your True North. Everything else is negotiable.

Most organisations would rather add values than live by them. But integrity isn't about what you claim to believe - it's about what you won't sacrifice when pressure hits.

Your True North reveals itself in your toughest moments, not your mission statement. It's what stops you cutting corners when nobody's looking. It's the principle that costs you something to keep.

Remember: If compromising it doesn't hurt, it was never really your principle in the first place.
