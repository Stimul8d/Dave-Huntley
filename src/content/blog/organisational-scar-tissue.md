Every "that won't work here" started with someone getting hurt. Not physically, but professionally. The response? A deep-seated fear that outlasts the original wound.

## Learning from Nature

Dr Steve Peters' "The Chimp Paradox" tells a profound story about learned behaviour. Researchers placed five primates in an enclosure with a ladder. At the top sat some fruit. When any of them tried to climb the ladder, all of them got sprayed with cold water.

It's worth noting that this is a thought experiment - we'd never condone such treatment of our fellow primates. But the lesson it teaches us about behaviour is powerful.

The group quickly learned to stop any member from climbing the ladder. After a while, the researchers stopped using the water, but the behaviour continued unchanged. Then they introduced a new member to the group. When this newcomer tried to climb the ladder, the others stopped them immediately. One by one, the researchers replaced each member of the original group. Despite none of the new group ever experiencing the water spray, they all enforced the same rule with the same vigour.

## The Human Pattern

Your organisation probably has similar patterns. Not from physical discomfort, but from professional pain. Perhaps it was that brilliant idea that backfired, or that innovation that cost someone their job. Maybe it was that change that exposed someone's weakness. **The original incidents fade from memory, but the fear remains embedded in your culture.**

## Beyond Process

This isn't about restrictive processes or governance - that's just a symptom. This is about something deeper: **the inherited fear that makes smart people stop thinking for themselves.**

You hear it in the resigned voices saying "We tried that before" - a decade ago, in a completely different context. You see it in the dismissive "That might work elsewhere, but..." - without any real consideration of why here is different.

## The Self-Fulfilling Fear

**What makes this particularly toxic is how we pass these fears on without questioning them.** New hires arrive full of fresh ideas and energy. Within months, they're enforcing limitations they've never experienced firsthand.

It's not malicious. It's not even conscious most of the time. It's just humans doing what humans do - learning from and teaching others what seems to keep us safe.

## Breaking the Cycle

Spotting organisational scar tissue means looking past the obvious. It shows up in decisions made from fear rather than opportunity. You'll find it wherever innovation dies to "we've always done it this way" without a single clear reason why.

## Celebrating Courage

The antidote to fear isn't process - it's courage. **When someone tries something new and fails, that's your chance to change the story.** Instead of adding another layer of protection, celebrate the attempt. Make heroes of the people willing to take smart risks, even when they don't pay off.

Your team's watching closely. When someone fails while trying something innovative, your response shapes the next decade of your culture. Turn those moments into stories about courage, not cautionary tales about risk.

## The Way Forward

Breaking free requires more than just changing rules or processes. It needs us to acknowledge the fear, understand its origin, and question whether that fear still serves us. **Most importantly, it requires the courage to try new approaches even when everything in our culture screams to maintain the status quo.**

## The Reality Check

Your organisation's current state isn't an accident. It's the product of every fear, every failure, and every lesson learned along the way. Some of those lessons were valuable. Many are just scar tissue restricting your movement.

The question isn't whether you have these scars. The question is whether you'll let them **define your future.**

Most importantly, stop letting inherited fears control your choices. **Some wounds need to heal.**
