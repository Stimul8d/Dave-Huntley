I could be at risk of being on the receiving end of a barrage of discredit here but the modern notion of managing for happiness, optimism and motivation should probably stop. For a while now I've noticed the idea causing much more harm than good.

"Heresy" you say!

This isn't about knocking Management 3.0 or similar approaches - they're doing good work. But like so many good ideas, the core message gets trivialised into something dangerous: a narrow-minded view that forces human behaviour into a simple good-positive versus bad-negative dichotomy.

That dichotomy is bollocks. Here's why.

## The Problem with Perpetual Positivity

In our efforts to create better workplaces, some cultures have grown into a state where we expect positivity from everybody, all the time. Negativity, scepticism and uncertainty have become socially unacceptable attitudes.

If you really believe that though, you're not **managing for happiness** - you're **choosing to only manage happy people**. That's a poor plan if you're working in reality.

The good-positive/bad-negative dichotomy completely misses two critical behaviours:
- **Bad-positive**: naivety and over-confidence
- **Good-negative**: scepticism and objectivity

Being perpetually positive in leadership is at best underutilising your team's negative skills. At worst, it's neglectful.

## Shit Happens - Deal With It

When something negative happens, **acknowledge it**. I'm not talking about blame, but the simple act of pointing out that something isn't working. For an organisation to function effectively, that has to happen at all levels.

When people, plans and organisations don't adjust to reality, trust evaporates like morning dew in a heatwave. Smart people turn into cogs in a matter of days and it takes significant effort to recover from that.

## The Mood Trap

Optimism, positivity and motivation are nice feelings. But they're just that - **feelings**. They're irrational, subjective, and governed by mood more than anything else. Are we really trying to manage for something that unpredictable?

It's pretty egotistical to think a person's mood can be completely driven by their work life. I care about the people I work with, but **I'm not responsible for their mood** being a happy one.

Behaviour is the external manifestation of mood. While it doesn't make sense to talk about happy behaviour, it does make sense to manage and coach for **effective behaviour**, regardless of mood.

## What Actually Matters

There are three critical skills we spend too little time on:
- **Discipline**: doing what needs doing regardless of how you feel
- **Objectivity**: seeing things as they are, not as you wish them to be
- **Composure**: maintaining effectiveness under pressure

When somebody says "we've tried this before, and it didn't work", you can't dismiss that as a negative attitude. That's just lazy management. Instead, acknowledge the objectivity and understand why it didn't work before.

When motivation fails (and if you're human, it does), you have to rely on discipline. Remember:
- **You don't have to want to do something to get it done**
- **You can be committed to try something, even when you don't think it will work**

## The Power of Equanimity

There's something better than perpetual happiness: **equanimity**. It's the ability to maintain mental calmness and composure, especially in difficult situations. Unlike happiness, which is a fleeting emotion, equanimity is a stable state of mind.

Think of it as **emotional stability** rather than emotional positivity. It's about maintaining your effectiveness regardless of whether things are going brilliantly or terribly. It's about having the composure to make good decisions when everything's on fire, and the restraint to remain critical when everything seems perfect.

**Equanimity isn't emotionless** - it's about having a balanced relationship with your emotions. You still feel happy, sad, frustrated, or excited. The difference is that these emotions inform your actions rather than control them.

In practice, equanimity looks like:
- Acknowledging problems without becoming overwhelmed by them
- Celebrating successes without becoming attached to them
- Making decisions based on reality rather than how you feel about reality
- Maintaining effectiveness regardless of your emotional state

## The Case for Calmness

When you accept that feeling unhappy or negative about something is a necessary part of being human, and you don't judge yourself for it, your own sense of wellbeing improves. There's **no pressure to be captain happy** anymore.

When you lead teams to understand this about each other, the group gels, politics disappears and work gets a lot calmer.

And calmness, I think, is a much more useful thing to manage for.

## The Reality Check

Don't feel the need to be happy all the time. That's myopic nonsense. **Happiness is not a measure of how good you are** at your job or as a person.

If you're managing people, focus on creating an environment that encourages objectivity and passion without emotional over-investment. The happiness of your team is not your responsibility. Do what you can to make work easier and more effective - that might make them happy as a result, but it can't be your only goal.

Let's stop creating cultures where only positivity shines. They're fake, fragile, and ultimately harmful to everyone involved.
