Best practices are the fast food of organisational improvement. They're everywhere, they're consistent, and they promise to solve all your problems. Just one catch: **they're making you worse at actually solving problems**.

I watched a bank spend Â£2M on implementing "industry standard practices" for their deployment pipeline. Eighteen months of consultants, training sessions, and lost productivity. You know what they got? **The same deployment process everyone else was using in 2019**. They could have copied it off GitHub for free.

Worst of all? They were proud of it. "We're following best practices now!" Fantastic. **You've just spent millions to be exactly as good as your competitors.**

**Best practices aren't best - they're just documented**. The truly brilliant stuff is buried in teams too busy shipping value to write blog posts about their methodology.

I worked with a team deploying thirty times a day using homegrown scripts and a weird approach to feature toggles. Nothing about it was "standard". The architecture astronauts would have had a fit. But it worked brilliantly. Team was delivering faster than anyone else in the company.

Until some bright spark decided to "help" them by standardising their pipeline. **Now they're down to weekly deployments, but hey - at least they're compliant**.

The damage isn't obvious at first. You stop thinking about your context. You ignore better solutions because they're not "standard". Your team loses ownership of their process. **And you end up solving problems you don't even have**.

Those costs compound. **Every time you reach for a best practice instead of thinking through a problem, you're training your team to stop thinking**. After six months, your brilliant engineers turn into process zombies, shuffling from standup to standup, mindlessly following ceremonies they don't believe in.

The moment someone documents a practice, it starts going stale. By the time something becomes widely accepted, it's years out of date. **That's why most best practices feel like they're solving yesterday's problems. Because they literally are**.

Last year, I worked with a team that threw out their entire agile process. Just binned it. Replaced it with two rules:
1. Ship something valuable every day
2. Talk to each other when you're stuck

**Their productivity went through the roof. Quality improved. Team morale soared**. Nothing about it was "standard", but it bloody worked.

When someone suggests a best practice, there's only one question worth asking: "What problem are we actually trying to solve?" Everything else flows from there.

The numbers tell the story. Every team I've seen slavishly implement best practices ends up slower, not faster. **Their cycle time goes up. Their deployment frequency drops. Their defect rate stays exactly the same**. But their process compliance? Oh, that's through the roof.

You want better than average? **Stop copying average solutions**. Understand your context deeply. Learn from others' experiences. Design solutions that fit your reality. Test and adapt constantly.

Best practices aren't evil. **They're just a lazy substitute for thinking**. And your organisation can't afford that kind of laziness.

Want better than average results? Do better than average thinking.

Here's a fun thought: **This entire article could end up as a best practice for avoiding best practices**. The irony would be delicious.
