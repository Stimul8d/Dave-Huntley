Right, let's build an x-matrix. You'll need Excel and about an hour with your team.

**Don't overthink the tools. Excel is perfect for this.**

## Start with the Template

The template looks intimidating but we'll fill it out step by step. This is what you'll be working on during your catchball session.

## Results First

Start with a senior leader identifying a key result. Not an approach or a method - a binary outcome. Think "10,000 daily active users" or "Triple advertising revenue this year".

Add it to the bottom-middle section. This is your anchor point for everything else.

## Strategy Next

Now the real work begins. What big initiatives would achieve that result? We're talking high-level here - "Improve security", "Reduce technical debt", "Achieve feature parity".

Keep it strategic. If someone dives into specifics, park that thought for later. You want everyone's input, but one strategy at a time.

## Score the Connections

Rate how strongly each strategy connects to your result:
- 3: Direct impact
- 2: Clear support
- 1: Weak link
- 0: No real connection

Brutal honesty time - if a strategy scores low, bin it. You've only got space for five, make them count.

## Tactical Time

Now we're getting specific. What actual work will deliver these strategies?

These need to be concrete actions: "Integrate live chat", "Launch AdWords campaign", "Create company blog".

Score these against your strategies just like before. Don't panic if some tactics only support one strategy - that's normal. But if most of your scores are low, rethink your approach.

## Add Your Metrics

You need to know if this is working. Most software teams already have the tools - Google Analytics, Zendesk, whatever you use.

Score how each metric tracks your tactics. Remember - correlation isn't causation. Just because you can measure something doesn't mean it matters.

## Close the Loop

Now connect your metrics back to your results. This is your feedback loop. Low scores here mean you're measuring the wrong things or aiming at the wrong targets.

## Own It

Last step - who's doing what?

Culture matters here. If you've done the catchball process properly, this part should be straightforward. Everyone's already been part of the conversation.

## Making It Work

A few vital points:
1. Keep it to one page
2. Maximum five items in each section
3. Score everything honestly
4. If something doesn't connect, drop it
5. Review and update regularly

Next time we'll talk about the catchball process - how to have these conversations properly and keep everyone engaged.

For now, grab the template and give it a go. **Remember - the goal isn't a perfect matrix. It's honest conversations about what matters.**
