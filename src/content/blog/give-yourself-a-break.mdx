A few years back, I told one of my developers that he was brilliant. I meant it. He was genuinely one of the best I'd worked with. His response? I was "blowing smoke up his arse."

That got me thinking. Why do talented people find it so hard to accept praise? Why do we put so much more emphasis on our **shortcomings** than our **abilities**?

## The Questions That Hold Us Back

In software, we're obsessed with doing things "right." We torture ourselves with endless questions:

Should all user stories be completed in a sprint?
Should I estimate bugs?
Should I learn the latest trendy language?
Should I have 100% test coverage?
Should I automate everything?

These aren't really questions about best practices. They're symptoms of something deeper - the nagging feeling that we're **Doing It Wrong**.

## A Simple Truth

Here's the thing about all those "should" questions: **There is no should**.

Anyone telling you there's only one right way to do things is the one doing it wrong. The real problem isn't your approach to story points or test coverage - it's the word "should" itself.

Try this: Replace "Should I" with "Could I". Better yet, try "What if I". Feel the difference? One path leads to doubt, the other to possibility.

## What Actually Matters

Your intent matters more than your implementation. Are you:
1. Making genuine progress?
2. Trying to do the right thing?
3. Looking out for your team?
4. Being honest about what you don't know?

If you answered yes to any of those, you're already ahead of the game. **That's** what sets you apart. Not your test coverage, not your deployment pipeline, not your choice of programming language.

## The Real Standard

It is **far** better to know you're wrong than to think you're right.

Think about that for a second. The developers I respect most aren't the ones who have all the answers. They're the ones who:
- Admit when they're stuck
- Ask for help when they need it
- Share what they learn
- Care about getting better

## A Better Mindset

Stop aiming for perfection. It's a mirage. Instead:
- Strive for progress
- Be wrong boldly
- Learn continuously
- Trust your judgement

You're not an imposter. You're someone who cares enough to question themselves. That already puts you ahead of most.

## The Bottom Line

If you're reading this and worrying about whether you're good enough, I can tell you right now: you are. The very fact that you care enough to worry about it proves it.

Give yourself a break. You're better than you think.
