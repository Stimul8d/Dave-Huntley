Do you actually know your goals? Not just your personal ones, but your team's goals, your department's goals, and your organisation's goals. More importantly, do they all point in the same direction?

I wrote recently about finding your True North - that crystal-clear picture of what your organisation stands for. When you apply that thinking to strategic planning, you get Hoshin Kanri. And before you rush to Google Translate, let me explain why this matters.

## The Alignment Problem

Ever waited months for another team to do their bit? Delivered something nobody ended up using? Found yourself arguing over which initiative matters more? Struggled to justify engineering best practices against feature deadlines?

That's not a scaling problem. That's misalignment.

The software industry has tried to solve this. Scrum has its product backlog. SAFe has its "Strategic Themes" and intimidatingly complex diagrams. Nexus and Scrum of Scrums try to coordinate multiple teams. I've seen these work exactly once, and I've been doing this a while.

## Enter Hoshin Kanri

Hoshin Kanri translates roughly as "compass management" - Ho (direction), Shin (needle), Kan (alignment), Ri (reason). It's a structured approach to making sure everyone's compass points the same way.

The traditional process has seven steps, but that's overkill for most of us. Here's what actually matters:

1. Define the results you want to see
2. Identify strategies that will deliver those results
3. Choose tactics to execute those strategies
4. Pick metrics that prove it's working
5. Assign clear ownership of each piece

## The X-Matrix: Your Strategic GPS

The X-Matrix is where this all comes together. Think of it as a single-page map showing how everything connects. It looks complicated at first glance, but it's deceptively simple:

The magic happens in how you fill it out. You use a process called catchball - think of it as strategic planning tennis. Here's how it works:

1. Start with results - what does success actually look like?
2. Bounce around strategies that could get you there
3. Define specific tactics for each strategy
4. Choose metrics that prove you're on track
5. Assign clear owners to each piece

The key is correlation. Each element should strongly connect to its neighbours. If your tactics don't clearly support your strategies, or your metrics don't actually prove your results, something's wrong.

## Making It Work

Here's a real example I've seen work:

**Result wanted**: 10,000 daily active users
**Strategy**: Improve customer engagement
**Tactics**: 
- Implement live chat support
- Launch personalised onboarding
- Add user feedback system

**Metrics**:
- Daily active users (obviously)
- Chat response time
- User satisfaction scores
- Feature adoption rates

Each tactic clearly supports the strategy. Each metric clearly proves progress. Nothing exists in isolation.

## Skip the Ceremony

You don't need to implement this across your entire organisation at once. Start with your team. Focus on your immediate sphere of influence. The process scales up naturally when it works.

Don't get hung up on monthly or yearly review cycles either. Use timeframes that make sense for your context. In software, that might mean quarterly strategies with monthly tactical reviews.

## The Real Power

The power of this approach isn't in the matrix or the meetings - it's in the clarity it creates. When everyone understands how their work connects to the bigger picture, you stop having arguments about priority. You stop building features nobody wants. You stop waiting on other teams who are "busy with other priorities."

Strategic alignment isn't rocket science. But it does require actually doing the work to create it. Start small, keep it simple, and focus on making clear connections between what you're doing and why you're doing it.

Your compass is probably pointing somewhere. Make sure it's pointing where you actually want to go.
