Most organisations overcomplicate strategic alignment. They'll spend months crafting the perfect vision, then wonder why nothing changes on the ground.

**The gap between strategy and execution isn't new. The Japanese solved it decades ago.**

## Enter Hoshin Kanri

Hoshin Kanri is a strategic planning process developed by Toyota. Its core principle? Strategy only works when everyone understands their part in it.

Not through endless PowerPoints or town halls. Through clear, measurable connections between:
1. Results you want to achieve
2. Strategy to get there
3. Tactics you'll employ
4. Measures that matter
5. People who'll make it happen

## The X-Matrix

The x-matrix is the visual heart of hoshin kanri. It's a single page that shows how everything connects.


But here's where most get it wrong - they treat it like a tick-box exercise. "Oh look, this project kind of relates to that goal. Let's put a dot there."

**That's not good enough.**

## Scoring Real Alignment

Instead of vague dots or circles, use numbers:
- 3: Direct, strong correlation
- 2: Clear supporting relationship
- 1: Weak or indirect link
- 0: No meaningful connection

Why? Because it forces honesty. That project you thought supported your strategy? Prove it with a number.

## The Power of Numbers

Look at the difference:
- "This marketing campaign supports our growth objective" (weak)
- "This campaign scores a 2 because it directly drives user acquisition but won't impact retention" (clear)

Numbers cut through the waffle. They expose gaps. They force real conversations about priorities.

## Five Core Elements

The x-matrix connects:

1. **Results** - Your breakthrough objectives (3-5 years out)
2. **Strategy** - Your annual objectives
3. **Tactics** - Specific improvement priorities
4. **Measures** - How you'll track progress
5. **People** - Teams and owners

Each connection gets scored. Each score must be justified.

## Getting It Right

Good x-matrices share these traits:
1. Fit on one page
2. Use consistent scoring
3. Show clear chains of impact
4. Expose resource conflicts
5. Drive actual decisions

**If yours doesn't do these things, you're doing it wrong.**

## The Reality Check

Your x-matrix should expose:
- Where your strategy lacks tactical support
- Which measures aren't linked to results
- Teams spread too thin across priorities
- Projects that don't drive your strategy

## Making It Work

Strategy deployment isn't a one-way process. It needs dialogue between levels - what the Japanese call "catchball". We'll cover that properly in a future post.

For now, focus on:
1. Being brutally honest with your scores
2. Justifying every connection
3. Acting on the gaps you find

## Next Steps

In my next post, I'll walk through building an x-matrix step by step. For now:
1. List your breakthrough objectives
2. Map your annual objectives
3. Note your improvement priorities
4. Be ready to score every connection

Remember: **The point isn't having a complete matrix. It's having an honest one.**
