Planning based on historical performance isn't just ineffective - it's actively destructive. When you plan using averages, you're not being pragmatic. You're **choosing to be mediocre**.

## The Fundamental Problem

Let's cut the nonsense and look at what actually happens when teams plan using velocity.

Your team's last six sprints looked like this:
- Sprint 1: Cleared 35 points - business as usual
- Sprint 2: Hit 42 points - solved a tricky technical problem
- Sprint 3: Managed 28 points - two people were off sick
- Sprint 4: Delivered 38 points - normal sprint
- Sprint 5: Smashed 52 points - everything just clicked
- Sprint 6: Struggled to 25 points - production issues ate our time

The average is 37 points. Looks sensible on paper. But hang on - we only hit anywhere near that number in two sprints out of six. What you're actually doing is **planning to hit a target that rarely exists in reality**.

## Why This Kills Performance

That average represents a coin flip - a 50% chance of delivery. But it gets worse. Teams don't even aim for the average. They aim lower.

No one wants to miss their targets, so teams naturally gravitate towards what they know they can achieve. They actively avoid pushing beyond their lowest performance numbers. After all, why risk failure?

The result? You're not just accepting mediocrity - you're **institutionalising it**.

## How Teams Make It Worse

When pressed for certainty, teams do three predictable things:

1. Overestimate everything - "Better add a few extra points for unknowns"
2. Use complex statistical models - "Our confidence interval suggests..."
3. Do less work - "Let's be conservative with our sprint commitment"

That last one is the killer. Teams naturally reduce their workload to make their numbers predictable. They're **choosing certainty over excellence**.

## The Real Cost

This isn't just about numbers. When you plan for average:

Your best people leave for more challenging work
Innovation dies because no one takes risks
Mediocrity becomes your ceiling, not your floor

## Breaking Free

Stop estimating unless you genuinely need to hit a fixed date. Instead:

Ship your MVP immediately
Get real features into production fast
Build trust through delivery, not promises

Remember: **Shipping code beats planning every time**.

## A Better Approach

Focus on your sprint goal - the why behind the work. If your estimates won't change what you tackle next, they're waste. The important work remains important regardless of how you estimate it.

There are only two real priorities: now or later. Everything else is theatre.

## The Path Forward

Want better results? Here's what actually works:

Take meaningful risks
Focus on outcomes, not output
Kill bad ideas quickly
Double down on what works

## The Choice

You can either plan to be average or plan to be brilliant. But here's the truth: **The moment you start planning to be average, you've already failed**.

The real wins don't come from predictability. They come from having the courage to push beyond what's comfortable.

Choose brilliance. Accept the uncertainty. Ship something that matters.
