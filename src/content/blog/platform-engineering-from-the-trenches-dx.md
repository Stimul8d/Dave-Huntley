Your developers are drowning in YAML. They're juggling seventeen different tools, three CI systems (because "we're migrating"), and enough documentation to fill the British Library. Your solution? Build them a platform.

Good instinct, terrible execution.

## The Platform Trap

Here's how it usually goes: You hire some smart platform engineers, give them six months, and they build you a beautiful internal developer portal. It's got all the bells and whistles - service templates, infrastructure as code, automated pipelines, even a fancy dashboard.

**And nobody uses it.**

Instead, your developers are still copying and pasting from that three-year-old wiki page, because it's the only thing they trust to actually work. Your beautiful platform is just another layer of complexity they have to work around.

## The Convenience Store Problem

Think about your local convenience store. It's there when you need it, stocks what you actually want, and lets you get in and out quickly. You don't have to fill out a form to buy milk or get three managers to approve your sandwich purchase. You definitely don't get a monthly dashboard of your snack velocity.

**Yet somehow, this is exactly what most internal platforms do.** They take simple things and wrap them in process, ceremony, and endless metrics. We've turned getting work done into navigating bureaucracy.

## What Developers Actually Need

I've built platforms for startups and banks. Here's what I've learned: **Developers don't want a platform. They want to ship code without getting stuck.**

That's it. Everything else is just noise.

When a developer sits down to work, they're not thinking about your platform. They're thinking about testing their changes, knowing it's safe to deploy, and how to fix things when they break. Your platform needs to answer these questions. Not with documentation, not with process, but with **working tools that make the right thing the easy thing.**

## The Path of Least Resistance

Here's a truth about developers: They'll choose a slightly worse solution that works right now over a better solution that might work later. That's not laziness - it's pragmatism. When you're trying to solve a problem, anything that breaks your flow is friction. **And friction kills productivity.**

Your fancy service catalog with seventeen required fields? That's friction. Your automated pipeline that takes 40 minutes to run? Friction. Your security scanning that randomly fails? Pure friction. Every time you make developers wait, you're training them to work around your platform.

## Making It Work

The perfect platform is a myth. **What matters is removing real friction from your developers' day.** Start with the basics: make local development actually work. That means container setup that takes seconds instead of hours, test data that's actually useful, and dependencies that just work.

Then get out of their way. Stop asking for approval on obvious things. Give clear, fast feedback when something's wrong. **Better yet, fix common problems automatically.** The best guardrail is one that developers never notice.

Most importantly, fix actual problems instead of symptoms. Stop building guardrails around broken processes. If something's tedious, automate it completely. If something's confusing, make the right way the default way. **Your platform should make good practices feel natural.**

## The Reality Check

Your platform team's job isn't to build a perfect system. **It's to make your developers more productive.** That means measuring things that matter - time from commit to production, steps in a deploy, how often developers need help. Not vanity metrics about platform usage or feature adoption.

Focus on what hurts. What's causing support tickets? Where do new starters get stuck? What makes developers swear at their screens? **These pain points are your roadmap.** Everything else is just noise.

Keep it ruthlessly simple. Every feature must earn its place. Every field you require is friction you're adding. Every piece of documentation you write is a small admission of failure. **If you need to explain it, you probably need to simplify it.**

## Starting Point

Want to know if your platform is actually helping? Ask your developers what made them curse at their computer today. Ask about their most annoying regular task. Find out what they'd fix first if they had the chance.

**Then fix those things.** Nothing else matters until you do.

In the next piece, we'll look at how to build the team that can actually deliver this. Spoiler: It's not just hiring more platform engineers.
