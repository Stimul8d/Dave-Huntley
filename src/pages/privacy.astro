          Let's keep this simple. This site collects basic analytics using Google Analytics to understand how many people visit and what they're interested in. That's it.
        </p>

        <h2>What We Collect</h2>
        <p>
          Google Analytics tracks:
          - Which pages you visit
          - How long you stick around
          - What country you're visiting from
          - What device you're using
        </p>

        <h2>What We Don't Collect</h2>
        <p>
          We don't collect any personal information. No names, no email addresses, nothing that could identify you personally.
        </p>

        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          Google Analytics uses cookies to work out if you're a new or returning visitor. You can block these through your browser settings if you prefer.
        </p>

        <h2>Questions?</h2>
        <p>
          If you've got questions about this, just <a href="/contact" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">get in touch</a>.
        </p>
