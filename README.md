# Dave Huntley

Portfolio and blog of a software delivery veteran. Two decades of shipping code, building teams and getting stuff done. No fluff, just real talk about software, leadership and continuous improvement. Built with Astro and TypeScript, obviously.

## What's This Then?

After years of writing posts, snippets and ideas in random places, I finally decided to put everything in one spot. This site is that spot. It's not just a portfolio - it's a working record of what I've learned about software, teams, and getting things done properly.

## Tech Stack

Built with [Astro](https://astro.build) because it's bloody fast and lets me write in whatever I fancy. The whole thing is TypeScript because life's too short for runtime errors. Styling is pure Tailwind - no frameworks or fancy bits needed.

## Structure

Pretty straightforward:
- `/src/content/blog` - Where the writing lives
- `/src/content/projects` - Stuff I've built that's worth showing
- `/src/components` - React bits and pieces
- `/src/pages` - Actual site structure

## Want to Build Something Similar?

1. Start with the [Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build)
2. Grab the content collections feature
3. Add TypeScript and Tailwind
4. Chuck in some React components if you need them
5. Deploy wherever you fancy (I use Netlify)

That's genuinely all there is to it. The rest is just writing and tweaking.

## Found a Problem?

Raise an issue or send a PR. I'm not precious about it.
